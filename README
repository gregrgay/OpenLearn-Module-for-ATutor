This project is under Google Summer of Code 2011.

OpenLearn Module for ATutor aims at developing a module for ATutor. 

Purpose:
I like the whole idea of OpenLearn. The OpenLearn website gives free access to Open University 
course materials. This is the place where we can find hundreds of free study units, each with a discussion forum. 
Study independently at our own pace or join a group and use the free learning tools to work with others. 
This is a great idea. The purpose of my project is to develop OpenLearn module for ATutor which will allow 
ATutor to search and retrieve OpenLearn content.

Deliverables:
•	A module for ATutor
•	Search OpenLearn for content based upon users’ requests
•	Retrieve content from OpenLearn
•	Fill content in common cartridge or content package
•	Use of pre available courses from OpenLearn on ATutor
•	ATutor template module
•	Testing
•	Documentation

Benefits:
•	As OpenLearn contains a lot of courses and open learning material, it is very nice thought to use them in ATutor. 
•	OpenLearn repository has too many of articles on variety of subjects, intelligent use of the content will make ATutor more useful.
•	OpenLearn already provides different mechanisms to interact with its repository so it will be not be tough to interact with it from ATutor.
•	Searching for particular topics will be made easier.
•	Integration of OpenLearn and ATutor will add a new dimension to ATutor.
